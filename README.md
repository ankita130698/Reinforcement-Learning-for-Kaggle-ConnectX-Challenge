# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Kaggle-ConnectX-Challenge
This project implements reinforcement learning agents for the Kaggle ConnectX competition using Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Double DQN (DDQN), and Actor-Critic (A2C) methods. The goal is to build an agent that learns optimal strategies for playing ConnectX by interacting with the environment.
